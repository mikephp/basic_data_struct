   <td><font color=red>Q: What kind of traversing FreeCap does?</font><br>
       A: Via FreeCap you can traverse only TCP or UDP connections. But UDP only via SOCKSv5, only via one proxy, and without NAT in the middle. 
       Others protocols (such as icmp, igmp etc) unable to traversing by architecture and RFC restrictions.

<tr>
   <td><font color=red>Q: Why UDP traversing doesn't work through NAT? (or: Why UDP chaining is not possible?)</font><br>
      A: Because in UDP traversing I should know what port will be used as 'source-port' of the outgoing datagrams. 
      If there're NAT in the middle, I unable to know it. it's ideology of NAT -- modify packets with setting new
      src-port for matching with IP in the internal tables when packet will arrived from Internet. 
      This is also a reason why UDP 'chaining' is not possible through set of SOCKSv5 servers.

   <td><a name="http"></a><font color=red>Q: I have working HTTP proxy (tested recently), but I unable to connect to any site trought FreeCap with this proxy. InternetExplorer deals with this proxy, but FreeCap doesn't. Why? </font><br>
       A: Here common problem with HTTP proxy at the users. There'is two types of HTTP proxies: 
"normal" i.e. cached proxy which doesn't support traversing, and proxy that supports. 
<b>Freecap <u>required</u> HTTP proxy that supports e.g. "CONNECT method"</b>.

<tr>
   <td><font color=red>Q: My FreeCap doesn't work! I run the NNN program, but connection is refued (or "Page cannot be displayed", etc) </font><br>
       A: There are some possible reasons.
         <ul>
             <li>Is your proxy still alive? 
             <li>If you sit in the LAN and trying to establish tunnel from Internet back to LAN.<br>
                 <i>For example: You run via FreeCap the Internet Explorer with HTTP proxy 192.168.0.1 set in IE settings</i><br>
             <li>Maybe your ISP have e.g. <b>transparent proxy</b>? <i>(This situation is most possible)</i>
             <li>Maybe your SOCKS/HTTP proxy required authorization and you forget about it?
             <li>If none of above then it's good idea to turn on logging in FreeCap.
         </ul>
